# pytorch_practice

Create train, validation, and test dataset.

Normalize the dataset, try standard normalization, in some cases min-max normalization.

Choose the model, as in how many layers and types of activation function.

Choose the loss function.

Choose the optimizer.

Run the gradient descent.

For each epoch, calculate and print the loss, and at the same time print accuracy.
